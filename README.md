# Project Title:
Roll Master 3000

## Description:
Developed a dice simulation program using Python.
The program allows users to simulate the rolling of dice, generating random outcomes and displaying the results.

## Technologies Used:
Python, Random Library, String Library, Object-Oriented Programming

## Role:
Designed and implemented the core algorithm to simulate the rolling of dice.
Provided customizable options for users to choose the number of dice and the number of sides per die.
Ensured the generator produced random and fair outcomes for each roll.
Conducted thorough testing to verify the randomness and accuracy of the dice rolls.

## Challenges and Solutions:

### Challenge:
Ensuring the randomness and fairness of the dice rolls.
### Solution:
Utilized Python's random library to generate truly random outcomes and performed statistical tests to validate the fairness of the simulation.
